# hangman

Dear Motorola Academy Team,

Many thanks for Your time spent for verification my first attempts in coding.
I hope that you will enjoy my beta version of Hangman game. I was able to fulfil most of the requirements in the time given and I wish to improve by becoming a Motorola Solutions and Codecool Team member.
For now, coding is something I try to tame, but as I find it interesting and challenging, finally I wish it to become my professional path. 
I'm motivated and I want coding to be my way for living.
